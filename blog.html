            prefer the individuals with higher education. It has now become impossible to 
            get a highly paid job without a diploma. Therefore, in order to become a dominant 
            leader in the corporate world there is a great importance of higher education. 
            The current era is the fast paced era and it is difficult to get the higher 
            education in this era.</p>
